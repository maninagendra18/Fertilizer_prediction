# Fertilizer_prediction
This project aims to predict the appropriate type of fertilizer for different soil and environmental conditions. By analyzing various features such as soil color, nutrient levels, rainfall, and temperature, the system recommends the most suitable fertilizer type.

# Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains information about soil characteristics, environmental factors, and the corresponding recommended fertilizer types. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers before training the predictive models.

# Analysis and Modeling:
Data Exploration: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the distribution and relationships between different features. Outliers and missing values were identified and addressed accordingly.

# Preprocessing: 
Data preprocessing techniques such as handling outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features were applied to prepare the data for modeling.

# Model Training: 
Several classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, were trained on the preprocessed data to predict the fertilizer type based on the input features.

# Model Evaluation:
The performance of each trained model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report on a holdout test set.

# Usage
To use the fertilizer prediction system:
Provide input values for soil color, nitrogen level, phosphorus level, potassium level, pH, rainfall, and temperature.
